Valid, because the API aligns with the energy sector domain by addressing carbon emissions based on energy usage, historical data trends, and sustainability strategies. It provides endpoints for computing emissions, analyzing trends, managing energy data, and offering actionable reduction strategies. The parameters are complete with descriptions, appropriate data types, and required/optional status clearly defined. The API is self-contained, as all necessary data (such as energy sources) can be retrieved from the given endpoints, and no external dependencies or inconsistencies are evident.
