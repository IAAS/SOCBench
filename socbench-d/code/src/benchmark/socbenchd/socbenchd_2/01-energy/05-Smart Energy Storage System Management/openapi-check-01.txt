Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the energy sector domain by addressing the management of energy storage systems and their integration with renewable energy sources. All required parameters are appropriately defined, each endpoint is well-documented, and the API is self-contained. IDs required for specific operations (e.g., energy storage system IDs or renewable source IDs) can be retrieved through relevant endpoints such as GET /storagesystems or GET /renewablesources, ensuring seamless usability and logical flows.
