Valid, because the OpenAPI specification is well-aligned with the Information Technology Sector domain, specifically focusing on incident response and management, which is critical for IT infrastructure teams. All endpoints are appropriately self-contained and logically structured. Necessary IDs (e.g., `alertId` and `incidentId`) can be retrieved from listing endpoints (`/alerts` and `/incidents`), and endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources are provided. Parameters and request/response schemas are complete and consistent with clear requirements and data expectations.
