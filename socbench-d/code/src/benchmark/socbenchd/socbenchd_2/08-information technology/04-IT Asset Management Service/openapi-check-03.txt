Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the information technology sector domain by providing endpoints for IT asset tracking, software license management, audit reporting, resource usage metrics, and alert setupâ€”all essential for IT governance and lifecycle management. The endpoints are cohesive, parameters are consistent, and the IDs required (e.g., assetId, licenseId) are retrievable or manageable through other endpoints. The provided schemas like Asset and License are complete and fulfill the requirements of the domain.
