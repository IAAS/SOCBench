Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Utilities Sector domain by addressing functionalities like distributed energy resource management, energy storage, load balancing, grid synchronization, and renewable energy analytics. It covers relevant operations and includes all parameters necessary for these functionalities. All endpoints are self-contained and IDs required for operations like updating or deleting distributed resources can be retrieved through other endpoints. The schema definitions are consistent and provide required structures for successful API interaction.
