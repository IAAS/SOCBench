Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Utilities Sector domain, focusing on smart meters and services for data aggregation, visualization, and analysis. All parameters required for the operations are defined, and the API appears coherent and self-contained. Meter IDs are retrievable via the `/meters` endpoint, and all applicable operations such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are logically defined and supported. The specification also includes analytics and alert functionalities that enhance its usefulness in the domain.
