Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Utilities Sector domain, specifically in the context of renewable energy production and analytics. The endpoints and schemas are self-contained and reasonable, covering predictive analytics, performance monitoring, resource optimization, and grid stability. Parameters such as location, source type, and date are clearly defined and logically structured. All endpoints are functional, and the data required for operations can be obtained within the API itself.
