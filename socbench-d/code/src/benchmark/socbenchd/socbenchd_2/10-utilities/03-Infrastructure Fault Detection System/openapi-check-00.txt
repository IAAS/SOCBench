Valid, because it aligns well with the Utilities Sector's need for monitoring and managing infrastructure, including pipelines and power grids. The API provides endpoints for retrieving infrastructure statuses, detecting anomalies, predicting failures, and managing maintenance schedules, which are critical for utility operations. All parameters are well defined, and the relationships between the endpoints ensure that components such as IDs and data are retrievable and usable throughout the API. The specification is self-contained and adheres to the domain's requirements without any missing parameters or inconsistencies.
