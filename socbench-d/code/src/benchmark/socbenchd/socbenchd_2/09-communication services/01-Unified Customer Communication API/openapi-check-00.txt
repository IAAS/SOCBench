Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Communication Services domain. It addresses multi-channel communication with functionality to send messages, track their statuses, create and retrieve templates, import and access contacts, manage engagement events, and generate analytics reports. All necessary parameters, such as message IDs and template IDs, are consistent and can be retrieved through the provided endpoints. The API is self-contained, logically structured, and supports operations required in this domain.
