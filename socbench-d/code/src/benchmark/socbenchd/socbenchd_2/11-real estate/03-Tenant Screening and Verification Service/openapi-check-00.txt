Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the given domain of the real estate sector by addressing tenant screening services such as identity verification, credit checks, and rental history reporting that are common needs for landlords and real estate management. All required parameters for the endpoints are defined, response codes and schemas are well-detailed, and the API is self-contained. Tenant-specific data such as `tenantId` is consistently used, and notifications, support contact endpoints, and tenant data deletion make the API comprehensive and functional for this domain.
