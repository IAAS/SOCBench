Valid, because the OpenAPI specification fits well with the Financials Sector domain by focusing on transaction monitoring, anomaly detection, and rule management for banking and financial services. All parameters are correctly defined, endpoints are self-contained, and necessary information (e.g., transaction IDs, alert IDs, rule IDs) can be retrieved or managed through other endpoints. The API provides complete functionality for the described use cases within the domain.
