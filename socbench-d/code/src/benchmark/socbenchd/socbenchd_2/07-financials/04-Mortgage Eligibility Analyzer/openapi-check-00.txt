Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Financials Sector domain by addressing mortgage loan services, including eligibility assessment, loan simulation, financial and credit data retrieval, property valuation, and application management. All endpoints cover relevant functionalities, and required parameters are included. The API is self-contained, as ID parameters (e.g., applicationId or valuationId) can be retrieved via other endpoints. The specification is consistent and supports the operations provided within the financial sector domain.
