Valid, because the OpenAPI specification fits the given domain of the Materials Sector, specifically forest products, which are part of the sectorâ€™s scope. The API focuses on monitoring the movements, certifications, and sustainability of forest products, which aligns well with the manufacturing and supply chain aspects of the domain. Additionally, the specification is reasonable, as all parameters and schemas are properly defined, and the API is self-contained. For example, forest product IDs can be retrieved via the `/products` endpoints, and these IDs are used across other endpoints, such as for movements, certifications, or updates. All necessary features for tracking and transparency are covered, and no critical parameters are missing.
