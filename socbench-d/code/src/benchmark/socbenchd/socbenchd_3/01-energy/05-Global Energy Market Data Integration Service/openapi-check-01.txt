Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Energy Sector domain, providing endpoints for pricing, supply levels, trade flows, geopolitical impact, renewable energy trends, and environmental impacts. The endpoints appear complete with parameters and responses structured appropriately for the described use cases. All options such as querying by energy type, region, or date range are available, and the API covers key functionalities relevant to the domain. The endpoints are self-contained and do not rely on external data sources for required parameters.
