Valid, because the specification aligns with the given domain of the energy sector and focuses on emissions reporting, regulatory compliance, and sustainability, which are relevant to the domain. All parameters appear correct, and the API is self-containedâ€”IDs such as "report_id" and "upload_id" can be generated or retrieved from endpoints (/emissions/reports, /data/uploads). The schema definitions and endpoints are clear, and all operations logically support the described functionality. No missing parameters or contradicting details were found.
