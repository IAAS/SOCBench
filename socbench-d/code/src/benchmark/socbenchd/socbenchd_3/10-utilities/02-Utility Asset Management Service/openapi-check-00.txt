Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Utilities Sector domain by addressing the organization and management of assets such as substations and transmission lines. It provides comprehensive endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating, and visualizing assets, as well as managing maintenance schedules, performance data, alerts, and GIS visualizations. IDs required for specific operations (e.g., assetId, alertId) can be retrieved from other endpoints, ensuring the API is self-contained and parameters are complete and correct.
