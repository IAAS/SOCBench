Valid, because the OpenAPI specification fits the Utilities Sector domain and comprehensively addresses utility network functionalities such as outage management, IoT sensor monitoring, renewable energy statistics, and customer communication. All endpoints have the necessary parameters, are self-contained, and allow for practical use within the domain. For example, IoT sensor IDs required in `/status/{sensor_id}` or `/sensor-calibration` can be logically assumed to be provisioned internally or through system setup. Additionally, the API facilitates incident reporting, outage history retrieval, and emergency simulations, aligning with the operational needs of utility companies. There are no missing parameters, and the API design appears functional and complete for the described purposes.
