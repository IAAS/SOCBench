Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Utilities Sector domain, specifically addressing simulation, analysis, and optimization of utility grids which are key components of the domain. All endpoints are well-defined with logical relationships, allowing functionalities such as grid retrieval, simulation, infrastructure updates, scenario management, optimization, and report access. IDs needed for specific operations (e.g., `gridId`, `scenarioId`, `simulationId`) can be retrieved through corresponding endpoints, making the API self-contained and reasonable.
