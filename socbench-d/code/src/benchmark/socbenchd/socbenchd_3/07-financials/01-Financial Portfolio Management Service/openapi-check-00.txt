Valid, because the OpenAPI specification fits the Financials Sector domain, as it provides endpoints for managing investment portfolios, retrieving financial data, and offering recommendations, all of which are pertinent to activities in banking, financial services, and capital markets. The API is well-structured, self-contained, and the necessary IDs (e.g., portfolio IDs) can be retrieved from other endpoints before being used in subsequent operations. Security is handled consistently with an API key, and all schemas and parameters are appropriately defined.
