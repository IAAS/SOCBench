Valid, because the OpenAPI specification matches the Information Technology domain by focusing on data integration, processing, analysis, visualization, synchronization, and exporting functionalities. All required parameters are defined, endpoints are self-contained, and IDs (like datasetId, schemaId, processId, etc.) can be obtained through other endpoints when needed, ensuring completeness and usability.
