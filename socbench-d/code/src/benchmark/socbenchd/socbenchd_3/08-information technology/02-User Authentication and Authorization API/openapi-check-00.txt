Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Information Technology Sector, specifically in managing users, credentials, and access control for software applications. It is self-contained, as all required operations such as registering users, authenticating, managing access controls, and handling application-related actions (registration, retrieval, and deletion) are supported. Parameters are appropriately defined, dependencies like application IDs are retrievable via related endpoints, security is addressed through JWT-based authentication, and responses are descriptive with proper error handling.
