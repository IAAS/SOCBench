Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the real estate domain and provides endpoints for exploring and managing properties, virtual tours, and realtors. The specification includes all necessary parameters, is self-contained, and IDs can be retrieved or managed appropriately. All endpoints required for the expected functionality are present and coherent with the domain description.
