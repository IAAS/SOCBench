Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Real Estate Sector domain and effectively supports the management of property listings. It includes functionalities to create, retrieve, update, and delete property listings while covering essential aspects like filtering, managing images, publishing to external platforms, and verifying publication status. All parameters are appropriate and IDs required in certain endpoints can be retrieved from others, ensuring the API is self-contained and semantically coherent.
