Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Energy Sector domain. The endpoints support functionalities such as retrieving energy consumption patterns, optimizing usage, forecasting, cost analysis, equipment monitoring, and managing alert settingsâ€”representing core aspects of the energy sector. All required parameters for each operation are appropriately defined, and any necessary IDs (e.g., for alerts) are retrievable or provided within operations. The API is self-contained and provides all essential paths and parameters to perform the described tasks effectively.
