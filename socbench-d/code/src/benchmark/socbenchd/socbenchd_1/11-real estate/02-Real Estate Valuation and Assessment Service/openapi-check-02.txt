Valid, because it aligns with the Real Estate Sector domain, providing endpoints for property valuation, market trends, REITs, and related services. It reasonably includes features necessary for operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting property data, as well as retrieving IDs (e.g., for properties or REITs). The parameters and data flows are self-contained, with essential features such as property IDs supported by corresponding endpoints.
