Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Financials Sector domain by providing services related to portfolio analytics, including performance analysis, diversification, risk assessment, benchmarks, alerts, reports, and market trends. All endpoints cover relevant aspects of financial portfolio management, and the API is self-contained as required IDs (e.g., portfolioId) are either provided or logically assumed to exist prior to interaction with the API. All parameters are described, and the API offers coherent functionalities with appropriately defined request and response structures.
