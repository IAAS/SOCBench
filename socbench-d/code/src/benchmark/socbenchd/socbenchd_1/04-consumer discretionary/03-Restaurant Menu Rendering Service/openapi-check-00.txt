Valid, because the API aligns with the Consumer Discretionary Sector by supporting restaurants with menu management, customization, and customer preference collection, which fall under the services segment. All necessary parameters are included, endpoints are well-defined, and the API is self-contained with mechanisms to retrieve, create, update, and delete menus and ingredients, as well as gather customer preferences and simulate previews. Unique IDs required for specific operations can be retrieved from appropriate endpoints.
