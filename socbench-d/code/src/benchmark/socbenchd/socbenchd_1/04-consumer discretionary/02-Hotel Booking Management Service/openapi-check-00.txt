Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Consumer Discretionary Sector domain, specifically the hotels and resorts segment. The API is reasonable, as it provides endpoints for reservation management, room details, and guest preferencesâ€”all necessary for a hotel or resort reservation system. The parameters are correct, IDs used in endpoints can be retrieved from other endpoints (e.g., room IDs from GET /rooms, reservation IDs from GET /reservations, guest preferences from GET /guest-preferences/{id}), and the API is self-contained and functional.
