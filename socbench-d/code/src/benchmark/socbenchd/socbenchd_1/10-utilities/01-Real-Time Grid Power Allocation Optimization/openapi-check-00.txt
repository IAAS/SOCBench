Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Utilities Sector domain by addressing key activities such as electricity demand management, resource allocation, renewable energy monitoring, and grid performance optimization. All necessary parameters and schemas are correctly defined, and IDs like `zone_id` can be retrieved from endpoints such as `/zones-status`. The API is well-structured, self-contained, and fully supports the described functionality within the domain.
