Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Information Technology Sector domain. It provides endpoints for managing IT equipment, software, compliance, analytics, and asset tracking, which are essential for IT inventory management. All endpoints are self-contained with proper parameter requirements, and IDs used in paths can be retrieved from list endpoints. The structure, schemas, and their relationships are logical and complete, ensuring the API is both functional and practical.
