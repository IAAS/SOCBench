Valid, because the API fits the domain of Information Technology by addressing the management, allocation, monitoring, optimization, and scaling of cloud computing resources, all of which are pertinent to this sector. The API endpoints cover all necessary operations, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources, as well as monitoring usage and setting up alerts. The parameters are coherent, dependencies like IDs are retrievable via other endpoints, schemas are well-defined, and the API is self-contained.
