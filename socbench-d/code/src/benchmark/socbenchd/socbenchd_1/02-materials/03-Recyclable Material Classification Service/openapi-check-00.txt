Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the domain of the Materials Sector by providing functionalities tailored to recyclable materials classification, waste stream analysis, and recycler compatibility. The endpoints are comprehensive, and the API is self-contained. For instance, material data can be classified via POST /materials/classify, material information can be retrieved and updated through respective endpoints, and recyclable facilities can be identified with GET /recyclers/compatibility. Identifiers like material IDs and stream IDs required in certain endpoints can be retrieved or established through other endpoints, ensuring consistent data flow. Parameters are correctly described, and the API documentation is clear and logical.
