Valid, because the OpenAPI specification comprehensively covers operations relevant to the Materials Sector domain such as tracking materials, managing procurement, checking inventory, optimizing logistics, and analyzing demand. All required parameters (e.g., material IDs, shipment IDs) can be retrieved or referenced from other endpoints, ensuring the API is self-contained and fully functional. The endpoints are logically structured and provide sufficient functionality for the domain, and the attributes and operations align with expected use cases in materials manufacturing and management.
