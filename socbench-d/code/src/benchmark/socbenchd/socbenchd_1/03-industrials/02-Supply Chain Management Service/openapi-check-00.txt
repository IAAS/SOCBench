Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Industrials Sector domain by supporting inventory tracking, order processing, and transportation route planningâ€”key components of goods flow coordination. The specification is semantically coherent, includes required parameters and schemas, and all endpoints are self-contained. IDs for items and orders can be retrieved from relevant endpoints, and no critical functionality appears to be missing.
