Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Health Care Sector domain by addressing key functionalities like remote consultation management, appointment scheduling, secure data exchange, and access to patient history. All endpoints are well-documented and provide necessary parameters. The specification ensures that IDs (e.g., patient_id, appointment_id, consultation_id, etc.) required by some endpoints can be acquired or tracked using other endpoints, making the API self-contained and reasonable for its intended use case.
