SUMMARY:
Judge an OpenAPI for a domain.

DOCUMENT:
Domain:
{domain}

OpenAPI:
{openapi}

TASK:
You are given a domain and an OpenAPI specification. Check the semantics and return either "Valid" or "Invalid" followed by an explanation.

EXAMPLE:
Valid, because it covers the area of collecting sensor data. All parameters are available and all endpoints can be called
Invalid, because it contains the following errors. 1. In endpoint POST /measurements, there is a parameter missing in the schema. [...]

INSTRUCTIONS:
You are an expert judge for an OpenAPI specification. First, check whether the specification fits to the given domain. Then, determine if the OpenAPI is reasonable, parameters are correct, and the API is self-contained. Check if, e.g., if an ID is needed this ID can be retrieved from another endpoint. Do not format the response.
