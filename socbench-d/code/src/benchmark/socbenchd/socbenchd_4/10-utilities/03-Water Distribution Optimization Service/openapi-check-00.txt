Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Utilities Sector domain by focusing on water management, monitoring consumption, detecting leaks, and promoting sustainability. The endpoints are comprehensive, covering key functionalities such as retrieving water consumption statistics, detecting leaks, analyzing trends, generating reports, managing system settings, and providing optimization suggestions. All parameters and inputs are correctly specified, including path and query parameters, and all endpoints are self-contained. For example, IDs such as "alert ID" in DELETE /alert/{id} can be retrieved from GET /alerts. The APIâ€™s structure is logical and supports the required processes within water distribution management.
