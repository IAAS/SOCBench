Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the specified domain of the Materials Sector, particularly mining operations. The API covers comprehensive features for monitoring safety, efficiency, and productivity through endpoints like alerts, thresholds, anomalies, and resource extraction. All necessary parameters, such as unique IDs for specific resources or anomalies, are appropriately included and tied to relevant operations. The specification appears self-contained, as all required identifiers can be retrieved or provided through the existing endpoints, and the schema definitions are clear and relevant to the described functionality.
