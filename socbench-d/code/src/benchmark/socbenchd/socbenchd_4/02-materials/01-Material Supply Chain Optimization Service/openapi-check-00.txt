Valid, because the OpenAPI aligns with the Materials Sector domain and comprehensively addresses essential operations like inventory management, supply chain optimization, transportation tracking, cost analysis, and strategic improvements. All requirements appear coherent, and IDs or input data required in operations (such as supplierId, shipmentId, or materialType) can logically be gathered from other endpoints like "/raw-material-sources" or "/inventory-overview". The API is self-contained, parameters are well-defined, and descriptions are consistent with the domain focus.
