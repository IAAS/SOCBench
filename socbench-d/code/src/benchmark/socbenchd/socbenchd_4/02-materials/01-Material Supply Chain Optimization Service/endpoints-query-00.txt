SUMMARY:
List the 10 most important endpoints for the given service.

DOCUMENT:
Domain:
Materials Sector: The Materials Sector includes companies that manufacture chemicals, construction materials, forest products, glass, paper and related packaging products, and metals, minerals and mining companies, including producers of steel.

Service:
The Material Supply Chain Optimization Service enables companies within the materials sector to efficiently manage and optimize their supply chain operations. This service aggregates real-time data from various supply chain stages including raw material sourcing, transportation logistics, and inventory levels. Through advanced analytics and machine learning models, the service provides recommendations for inventory management, supplier selection, and transport route optimization. By integrating this service using RESTful API endpoints, users can obtain actionable insights to reduce costs, improve delivery times, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.

TASK:
Given the description of the service, please think what could be the 10 most important endpoints of the service.

EXAMPLE:
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "endpoint": "GET /sensors",
            "description": "Retrieve the list of all available sensors."
        }
        ...
    ]
}

INSTRUCTIONS:
You are given a domain and a corresponding service. You are tasked to list endpoints for a given service. These should be specific for the service. The previously created endpoints are given. You can decide which endpoints these are. Align them with the service description. Avoid generic endpoints not related to the domain like authentication or user management. List them as "Verb Path" and add an extensive description as JSON. The endpoints should be different from the already previous ones. Make sure that the endpoints are consistent, compatible with each other, and in total create a self-contained service.
