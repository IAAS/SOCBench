Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Materials Sector domain by focusing on material properties, search, optimization, and related functionalities. The endpoints cover retrieving material details, searching by properties, accessing environmental ratings, recommendations for design optimization, and integrations. All parameters and IDs required for operations such as fetching detailed properties or searching by criteria are provided or retrievable from other endpoints, ensuring the API is self-contained and actionable. The design is semantically consistent with the domain and allows comprehensive interactions within the scope of material management and optimization.
