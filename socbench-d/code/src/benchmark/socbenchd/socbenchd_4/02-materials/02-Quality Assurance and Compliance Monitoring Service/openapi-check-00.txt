Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Materials Sector domain by addressing product quality, regulatory compliance, monitoring, and analysis of materials. All necessary endpoints are included (e.g., uploading and retrieving material specifications, integrating sensors, fetching compliance reports, and managing thresholds). IDs for resources like specifications and reports are retrievable via other endpoints, ensuring the API is self-contained. The data schemas are consistent, well-structured, and cover all required parameters for operations.
