Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the Financials Sector domain by providing services for creditworthiness assessments, credit scores, financial reports, and product recommendations. The endpoints are coherent, parameters are correctly defined, and the API is self-contained. For example, assessment IDs or user IDs required in certain endpoints can be derived or retrieved from related endpoints such as listing assessments or retrieving credit scores. All necessary components to enable proper functionality within the financial domain are present.
