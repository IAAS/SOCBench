Valid, because the API aligns with the Financials Sector domain. It provides endpoints for managing financial transactions, user accounts, currency exchange rates, and financial summaries, all of which are relevant to banking and financial services. The OpenAPI specification includes proper endpoint paths and descriptions, ensures completeness by allowing retrieval or creation of required IDs (e.g., account IDs, transaction IDs), and uses consistent security with a bearer token. It is self-contained and appropriately designed for its stated domain and purpose.
