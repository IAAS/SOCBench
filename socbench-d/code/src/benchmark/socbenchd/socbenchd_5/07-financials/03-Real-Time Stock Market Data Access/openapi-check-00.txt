Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the financial sector domain, providing endpoints for retrieving live stock data, market insights, historical asset information, and financial news which fall under banking, financial services, and capital markets. It is reasonable, with correct parameters, and self-contained. IDs or symbols required in endpoints can be assumed to be commonly known in the financial domain or retrieved externally, and the API provides sufficient coverage for operations typical in this domain without missing critical components.
