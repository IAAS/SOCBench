Valid, because the API aligns well with the domain of the Materials Sector, specifically focusing on mining operations. It covers key functionalities such as machinery and personnel allocation, inventory management, operations optimization, site details retrieval, and efficiency reporting. The API is semantically consistent, with proper use of parameters and logical interconnectivity between endpoints (e.g., siteId is referenced consistently and site details can be retrieved from "/sites/details"). All necessary data for operation is retrievable through other endpoints, making the API self-contained and reasonable.
