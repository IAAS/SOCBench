Valid, because the OpenAPI specification fits the healthcare sector domain by providing functionality for managing appointments, healthcare professionals, patients, facilities, and notifications. The specifications are self-contained and reasonable, as the required IDs (e.g., patientId, professionalId) can be retrieved from corresponding endpoints such as `/patients/{id}` and `/professionals`. Parameters are defined correctly, and the API provides sufficient endpoints for managing and accessing data relevant to healthcare operations.
