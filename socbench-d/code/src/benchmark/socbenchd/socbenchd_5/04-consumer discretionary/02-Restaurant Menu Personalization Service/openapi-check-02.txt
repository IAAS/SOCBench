Valid, because the OpenAPI specification appropriately fits the given domain of the Consumer Discretionary Sector. It covers relevant business activities like restaurant services, customization of dishes, menus, dietary preferences, and feedback handling. The API includes the necessary endpoints and parameters, ensuring that IDs (like menu template IDs and restaurant IDs) can be retrieved or used consistently across requests. The OpenAPI is well-structured, endpoints are self-contained, and no critical parameters or functionalities are missing.
