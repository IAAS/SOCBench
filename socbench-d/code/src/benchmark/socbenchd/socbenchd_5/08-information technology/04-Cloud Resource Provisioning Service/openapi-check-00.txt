Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns with the given domain of the Information Technology sector by providing endpoints for managing cloud resources such as creation, update, scaling, tagging, and performance metrics, which are relevant operations within IT infrastructure management. All necessary parameters, such as resource IDs, are provided and retrievable through endpoints like GET /resources or GET /resources/{id}. The API is self-contained, as it allows for operations across resources, metrics, regions, and tags, ensuring end-to-end functionality.
