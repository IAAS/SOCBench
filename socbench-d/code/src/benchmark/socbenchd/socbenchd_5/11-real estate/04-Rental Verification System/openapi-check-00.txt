Valid, because the specification aligns with the Real Estate Sector domain by providing endpoints related to rental applicant validation, verifications, rental property information, and compliance report generation, which are relevant services within the real estate industry. All required parameters such as `applicant_id` and `verification_id` are provided and retrievable from other endpoints. The API is self-contained as it allows for creating, retrieving, updating, and managing applicant and verification information, making it functional and compliant with the domain requirements.
