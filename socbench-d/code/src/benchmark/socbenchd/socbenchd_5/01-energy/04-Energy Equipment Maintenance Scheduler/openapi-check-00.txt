Valid, because it aligns with the energy sector domain by addressing maintenance management, equipment monitoring, and alert generation, which are critical for ensuring operational reliability. The API is well-structured, and all endpoints appear self-contained. For example, equipment IDs used in maintenance and alert-related operations can be derived from data provided by endpoints like `/equipment/status`. The required parameters are consistently defined in both request bodies and path parameters, ensuring clarity. Responses and data flows are logical and meet the operational needs for this domain. All necessary IDs and parameters are accessible through corresponding endpoints, supporting seamless integration and usage.
