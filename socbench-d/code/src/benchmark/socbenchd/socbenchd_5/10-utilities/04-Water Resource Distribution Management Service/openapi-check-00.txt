Valid, because it aligns with the Utilities Sector domain by providing tools and endpoints for the efficient management of water distribution networks, which are part of the utilities sector. The OpenAPI specification defines endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete network configurations and retrieve analytics, sensor data, and reports. All parameters are accounted for, and required IDs can be retrieved using other endpoints (e.g., GET /networks lists networks with their unique IDs, which can then be used in other endpoints like /networks/{id}). It is self-contained, and endpoints are logically structured and comprehensive for managing water distribution systems.
