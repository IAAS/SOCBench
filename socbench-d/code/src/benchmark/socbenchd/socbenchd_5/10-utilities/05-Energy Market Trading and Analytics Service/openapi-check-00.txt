Valid, because the OpenAPI specification aligns well with the Utilities Sector domain, specifically energy market activities such as energy trading, analytics, producers and consumers management, and distribution. All necessary parameters are defined, and the API is comprehensive and self-contained. For instance, trade IDs required for modifying or canceling trades can be created via the POST /market/trade endpoint. Similarly, regions and intervals for forecasts are clearly defined, and analytics endpoints provide data for both general and customized needs. The relationships between endpoints are logical, making it suitable for the domain.
